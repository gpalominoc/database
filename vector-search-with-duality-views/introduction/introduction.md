# Part 2: Vector Search with Duality Views

## Introduction

This workshop is Part 2 of a movie-search learning path. [Part 1: Search Using MongoDB API for Oracle AI Database](https://github.com/gpalominoc/database/tree/main/search-using-mongodb-api) explores keyword, semantic, and combined search from MongoDB Shell. Here, you will use SQL to explore the database structures behind search and build a JSON document interface with JSON-relational duality views.

Modernizing an application often means adding JSON interfaces and search to data that already lives in a database. Duality Views let applications consume JSON documents while SQL continues to work with the underlying tables. You will build a movie-search data layer in Oracle AI Database. It combines document access, semantic search, and independent embedding models.

The movie catalog gives you a concrete example of that change. A user might know an exact title, describe a theme, or ask which movie fits a particular situation. Each request calls for a different way to find and present information. You will build those capabilities over shared movie data rather than maintain separate copies for each access pattern.

The workshop progresses from SQL search to a JSON document interface and then an AI agent. Along the way, you will compare embedding models and inspect how the database retrieves results. The goal is to understand how these pieces work together and where each belongs in an application.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60–90 minutes

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the search concepts in Part 1 is recommended. This workshop includes its own data setup and does not require objects created in Part 1.
- Autonomous AI Database 26ai with AI Vector Search enabled.
- SQL worksheet or SQLcl access.
- Either an ONNX embedding model already available to the database, or access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage bucket where you can upload the provided models.

### Objectives

- Keep JSON movie data independent from its embedding columns.
- Run text and semantic searches with SQL.
- Compare embedding models and migrate search without rewriting the movie JSON.
- Use a duality view to expose movie data and search metadata as one JSON document.
- Verify vector index access when retrieving search results as documents.
- Build a Select AI agent grounded in movie search.

## About this workshop

Imagine a movie catalog whose next feature is a discovery assistant. The catalog already supports reporting and maintenance through SQL, but the new application needs JSON responses and searches based on story themes. Duality Views let both applications use the same stored data. Teams can add a document interface without maintaining another catalog and a process to keep its records synchronized. The same approach suits a retailer adding product discovery or a support team building a knowledge portal over existing records.

Search also needs room to evolve. A model that works well for short movie descriptions might perform differently on multilingual content or specialized terminology. Keeping embeddings separate from the original JSON lets teams compare models over the same records and migrate search at their own pace. Independent vector columns and indexes make that change easier to manage, while the Duality View presents the selected data as documents. Direct SQL adds control over these structures and visibility into their search plans, extending the collection-oriented approach from Part 1.

The agent turns those search results into a conversation. A question such as "Which movies feature a rescue mission, and what are they about?" prompts a movie-search tool to retrieve relevant documents. Select AI uses that context to compose a response grounded in the catalog. This retrieval-augmented generation pattern can also help a shopping assistant explain product options or a support assistant answer questions from relevant articles. The value comes from connecting useful database content to the answer, with retrieval and response quality evaluated together.
